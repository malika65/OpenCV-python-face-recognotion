# OpenCV with Python: Face Recognition and Identification
## Project for face recognition and identification

üòÄ Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using their face. üòÄ

üåê Perhaps Facebook correctly tagged you and your friends in some photos you recently uploaded and you wondered how it knew who was who. Facebook‚Äôs facial recognition technology, DeepFace, is able to identify human faces in digital images. Their system is said to be 97% accurate, much higher than even the FBI‚Äôs Next Generation Identification system at 85%.

üôç Facial biometrics continues to be the preferred biometric benchmark. 
That's because it's easy to deploy and implement. There is no physical interaction with the end-user. 
Moreover, face detection and face match processes for verification/identification are speedy.

There are several reasons for recent increased interest in face recognition, including rising public concern for security, the need for identity verification in the digital world, face analysis and modelling techniques in multimedia data management and computer entertainment.

## üìñ  Presentation of project [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iIUbfmsR_Ux9VBo815pV_O3pJX6TTV7n?usp=sharing)

## Features
This project use uploaded images, than thained. After it can recognize which person is on the camera.

## Development

Dillinger uses Python for developing.

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

python -m venv venv
```

Second Tab:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### How to recognize your face

Into folder images create folder with your name and there several of yours photos.

After run file faces-train.py to make your system train with new images:

```sh
python faces-train.py
```

## Last step

Know run faces.py and see how it recognize and identify your face

```sh
python faces.py
```
